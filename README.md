### P4-Website Performance Optimisation Portfolio Project

You will find 2 folders: `src` and`dist`. The first one contain all the original files. The second one all the files with my modifications. 
For index.html the goal was to score over 90 in [Google PageSpeed Insight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and for pizza.html achieve a frame rate at 60fps when scrolling the page and resize the pizzas in less than 5ms.

You can see the result [here](https://github.com/mapkala/P4-Website-Optimization)
